# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Analysis Project

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Josef, and in this project, I'll be analyzing a real dataset of U.S. Medical Insurance Costs provided by Codecademy. We'll explore various aspects of this dataset to gain insights into healthcare expenses, including age groups, smoking habits, BMI, the number of children, geographical variations, and gender-based differences in medical charges.

## Data Preparation

First, we start by extracting data from the provided `insurance.csv` file. The data is cleaned and processed into a usable format for analysis. We convert string numbers into integer data types and round charges to two decimal places.

## Average Charges by Age Group

We investigate the relationship between age and medical charges. After analyzing the age distribution, we divide it into five age groups: Group I (15-25 years old), Group II (25-35 years old), Group III (35-45 years old), Group IV (45-55 years old), and Group V (55-65 years old). We calculate the average charges for each age group and observe that, on average, charges increase with age.

## Charges Comparison for Smokers vs. Non-Smokers

Next, we compare the average medical charges between smokers and non-smokers. This analysis reveals that smokers have significantly higher average charges compared to non-smokers, highlighting the impact of smoking on healthcare costs.

## BMI Distribution and Average Charges

We examine the distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) in the dataset and investigate how it relates to average medical charges. The analysis shows that as BMI increases, the average charges also increase, indicating a correlation between weight status and healthcare expenses.

## Effect of Number of Children on Charges

We study the relationship between the number of children and medical charges. The analysis indicates that having three children is associated with the highest average charges, while having five children is associated with the lowest average charges.

## Geographical Variation in Charges

We analyze the average medical charges across different regions, including North-East, North-West, South-East, and South-West. The results show regional disparities in healthcare costs, with the South-East region having the highest average charges and the South-West region having the lowest.

## Gender-based Charges Comparison

Finally, we compare the average charges for males and females. The analysis reveals that, on average, males have higher medical charges than females, suggesting gender-based differences in healthcare costs.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into U.S. medical insurance costs by examining various factors that influence charges. It highlights the importance of factors such as age, smoking habits, BMI, the number of children, geographical location, and gender in understanding healthcare expenses.
